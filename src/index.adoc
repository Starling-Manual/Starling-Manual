// introduction

The goal of this manual is to provide an extensive introduction to the http://www.starling-framework.org[Starling Framework].
Starling is a cross-platform engine for _ActionScript 3_ that can be used for all kinds of applications, with a special focus on 2D games.

In this guide, you will learn:

* The technologies Starling was built upon and the principles it follows.
* How to pick an IDE and set it up for your first project.
* The basic concepts like the display list, events and the animation system.
* Advanced techniques, like how to tap into the potential of fragment and vertex programs.
* How to get the best performance out of the framework.
* What's required to get your game to run on mobile phones and tablets.

Keep on reading to dive right into it!

I'm also working on a book that contains not only the complete contents of this manual, but adds lots of additional HOW-TOs and guides.
A step-by-step tutorial will lead you through the development of a *complete game*.
