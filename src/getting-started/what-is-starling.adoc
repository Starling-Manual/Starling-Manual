== What is Starling?
ifndef::imagesdir[:imagesdir: ../../img]

The _Starling Framework_ allows you to create hardware accelerated apps in _ActionScript 3_.
The main target is the creation of 2D games, but Starling may be used for any graphical application.
Thanks to _Adobe AIR_, Starling-based applications can be deployed to all major mobile and desktop platforms.

While Starling mimics the classic display list architecture of _Adobe AIR/Flash_, it provides a much better performance: all objects are rendered directly by the GPU (using the _Stage3D_ API).
The complete architecture was designed for working well with the GPU; common game development tasks were built right into its core.
Starling hides _Stage3D_ internals from developers, but makes it easy to access them for those who need full performance and flexibility.

=== Why another display API?

As outlined above, Starling's API is very similar to the native Flash API, namely: the `flash.display` package.
So you might ask: why go to all that effort to recreate Flash inside ... err, Flash?

The reason is that the original `flash.display` API, with its flexible display list, vector capabilities, text rendering, filters, and whatnot, was designed in an era of desktop computers.
Those computers had powerful CPUs, but (by modern standards) primitive, fixed-logic graphics hardware.
Today's mobile hardware, on the other hand, has an almost reversed setup: a weak (i.e. battery-conserving) CPU with a very advanced graphics chip.

The problem: it's extremely difficult (if not impossible) to change an API that was designed for pure CPU rendering to suddenly use the GPU efficiently.
Thus, such attempts failed spectacularly, and the Flash plug-in is nowadays completely gone from browsers on phones and tablets.

To its credit, Adobe was very aware of this issue.
That's why, back in 2011, they introduced a low level graphics API called _Stage3D_.
That API is decidedly low-level; it's basically a wrapper of _OpenGL_ and _DirectX_, allowing developers to access the raw power of the GPU.

The problem: such a low-level API didn't help users of the classic display list much, at least not right away.
The _Stage3D_ API is as low-level as it gets, so it's nothing a typical developer can (or should!) directly work with when creating an app or game.
Clearly, Adobe needed a more high-level API, built on top of _Stage3D_, but as easy to use as `flash.display`.

Well ... this is where Starling enters the stage (pun intended)!
It was designed from ground up for _Stage3D_, while mimicking the classic Flash API as much as possible.
This makes it possible to fully leverage today's powerful graphics hardware, while using concepts countless developers are already familiar with.

Adobe could have made such an API themselves, of course.
However, monolithic APIs built by big companies have the tendency to become big and inflexible.
A small open source project, on the other hand, powered by a community of equal-minded developers, can act much more swiftly.
That's the insight that led _Thibault Imbert_, product manager of the _Flash_ and _AIR_ platforms in 2011, to initiate the Starling project.

To this day, Starling is funded and supported by Adobe.

TIP: There is an interesting blog article in which one of Adobe's engineers describes the reasons for supporting Starling instead of providing an accelerated version of the classic display list.

=== Starling's philosophy

One of the core aims of Starling was to make it as lightweight and easy to use as possible.
In my opinion, an open source library should not only be easy to use -- it should also encourage diving into the code.
I want developers to be able to understand what's going on behind the scenes; only then will they be able to extend and modify it until it perfectly fits their needs.

That's why Starling's source is well documented and surprisingly concise.
With a size of just about 15k lines of code, it's probably smaller than most games that are written with it!

[TIP]
====
I really want to emphasize that: if you're one day stuck or confused why your code isn't working as expected, don't hesitate to step into the source code of Starling.
Oftentimes, you'll quickly see what's going wrong, and you'll get a much better understanding of its internals.
====

Another important goal of Starling is, of course, its close affinity to the display list architecture.
That's not only because I really like the whole idea behind the display list, but also to make it easy for developers to transition to Starling.

Nevertheless, I was never trying to create a perfect duplicate.
Targeting the GPU requires specific concepts, and those should shine through!
Concepts like _Textures_ and _Meshes_ aim to blend in seamlessly with the original API, just as if it had always been designed for the GPU.
