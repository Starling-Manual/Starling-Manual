== Choosing an IDE

As you have just read, Starling apps and games are built using the _Adobe AIR SDK_.
Technically, you could just use a text editor and the command line to compile and deploy your code, but that's not recommended.
Instead, you'll definitely want to use an integrated development environment (_IDE_).
That will make debugging, refactoring and deployment much easier.
Thankfully, there are several to choose from.
Let's look at all the candidates!

IMPORTANT: The prices specified below were effective in April 2017.
Please check the product sites for the very latest prices and plans.

=== Adobe Flash Builder

_Flash Builder_ is the official IDE from Adobe; you might also know it under its former name _Flex Builder_.
You can either purchase it as a standalone version (in a standard and premium edition) or get it as part of a _Creative Cloud_ subscription.

Built upon _Eclipse_, it is a very powerful piece of software, supporting all the features you'd expect, like mobile debugging and refactoring.
The premium edition even includes a very useful performance profiler.

Personally, I used _Flash Builder_ for a very long time, and the Starling download even comes with suitable project files.
However, there is one caveat: _Flash Builder_ has apparently been abandoned by Adobe. The last update (version 4.7) was released in late 2012, and it wasn't particularly stable.
There are no indications that this situation will change anytime soon.

Thus, I can only recommend it if you are a _Creative Cloud_ user anyway (because then, you'll get it for free), or if you've got an old license lying around somewhere.
Don't get me wrong: it has a great set of features, and you will get stuff done with it.
But you will have to live with occasional crashes, and updating the AIR SDK is a chore.

Platforms:: Windows, macOS.
Price:: USD 249 (Standard Edition), USD 699 (Premium Edition).

=== IntelliJ IDEA

The next candidate might be called "the IDE to rule them all", because _IDEA_ supports a plethora of languages and platforms.
AIR support is handled via the plug-in "Flash/Flex Support".

I've been using IDEA for quite a while, and I really like it (especially for its powerful refactoring features).
Feature-wise, it feels just like it was built for AS3; all the important parts are in place.

Different to _Flash Builder_, the IDE receives regular updates.
Unfortunately, that's not the case for the Flash plug-in in particular, though.
There are some (minor) deficits that have been waiting for a fix for quite a while.

That's all just nitpicking, though.
It's an excellent IDE, and it's my recommendation if you're on macOS.
The only caveat might be that _JetBrains_ recently switched to a subscription based pricing model, which might not be attractive for everybody.

There's also a free community edition of IDEA, but unfortunately it doesn't include the _Flash/Flex Support_ plug-in.

[horizontal]
Platforms:: Windows, macOS.
Price:: For individuals: USD 149 (first year), USD 119 (second year), USD 89 (third year onwards). Business licenses are more expensive (USD 499/399/299 per year).

TIP: The subscription model contains a so-called "perpetual fallback license", which means that after 12 months, you'll be able to keep a version of IDEA even if you cancel the subscription.
Personally, I think this mitigates the downsides of the subscription model.

=== FlashDevelop

As much as I love working on macOS, here's an area where I occasionally envy Windows users: they have access to an excellent free (open source) IDE for Starling development: _FlashDevelop_.
It has been around since 2005 and is still seeing updates on a regular basis. If you're into _Haxe_, it has you covered, as well.

Since I'm primarily using macOS, I don't have very much first-hand experience with _FlashDevelop_; but from countless posts in the Starling forum, I've heard only good about it.
Some people are even using it on the Mac via a virtual machine (like _Parallels_).

Platforms:: Windows only.
Price:: Free and open source.

=== PowerFlasher FDT

Just like _Flash Builder_, _FDT_ is built on the _Eclipse_ platform.
Thus, it's a great choice when moving away from _Flash Builder_, since it all looks and feels very similar.
You can even import all your _Flash Builder_ projects.

FDT does improve on _Flash Builder_ in several areas; for example, you can easily change the type of an existing project from _Flash_ to _AIR_ -- something that is impossible in _Flash Builder_.
It also supports several additional languages, like _HTML5/JavaScript_, _Haxe_ and _PHP_.

All in all, it's a very solid IDE.
If you like Eclipse, you can't go wrong with _FDT_!

TIP: There is even a free edition available, which is a great way to get started.
Contrary to what the product page suggests, you can also use it for mobile AIR development.

Platforms:: Windows, macOS.
Price:: Between USD 25 and USD 55 per month (depending on contract length). Students and teachers may apply for special terms.

=== Visual Studio Code

_Visual Studio Code_ is a lightweight but powerful source code editor that's available for all major desktop operating systems.
It does not provide any ActionScript support out of the box, but there is an extension in the works that might make it a viable (and free!) alternative to the other IDEs soon.

The https://nextgenactionscript.com/vscode/[NextGen ActionScript] extension is being developed by Josh Tynjala, who has also brought you the fantastic _Feathers_ user interface components.
It turns Visual Studio Code into a fully-fledged ActionScript development environment, including code intelligence features like auto-completion, automatic class imports, etc.
At the time of this writing, Josh just added support for debugging SWF files in AIR or Flash Player -- the deal-breaker for any serious development environment.

Being brand-new, it's still a little rough around the edges, but (knowing Josh) I have no doubt that this extension is going to become rock-solid in the future.
Definitely keep an eye out for this one!

=== Adobe Animate

If you're a designer or a developer who has been using Flash for a very long time, you might wonder where _Adobe Flash Professional_ is coming up in this list.
Well, here it is!
If you're not recognizing it, that's because Adobe recently renamed it to _Adobe Animate_.
That actually makes a lot of sense, since the new name reflects a major change in its focus.
_Animate_ is now a general-purpose animation tool, supporting output not only to Flash, but also _HTML5_, _WebGL_, and _SVG_ formats.

While you can use _Animate_ for Starling, I wouldn't recommend it.
It's a fantastic tool for designers, but it simply wasn't built for writing code.
You'll be much better off using it just for the graphics, and writing the code in one of the other mentioned IDEs.

Platforms:: Windows, macOS.
Price:: Starting at USD 19.99 / month (for a "Single App" Creative Cloud subscription).
