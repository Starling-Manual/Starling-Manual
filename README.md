# The Starling Manual

The goal of this manual is to provide an extensive introduction to the [Starling Framework][1].
Starling is a cross-platform engine for _ActionScript 3_ that can be used for all kinds of applications, with a special focus on 2D games.

This repository provides the basis for the online manual found here:
[http://manual.starling-framework.org]()

It is written in the [AsciiDoc][2] markup language and can be easily compiled into HTML, PDF and EPUB.
Have a look at the `BUILD.md` file to find out how to compile the source yourself.

## Translating the Manual

Are you interested in helping out the Starling community by translating this manual into your native language? (Think of it: eternal fame and thankfulness of the Starling community would be yours!)

If so, please simply open up an issue in this repository, stating the language you want to help with.
I will then create a fork of this repository and set it up for you with full access rights.

Thanks a lot in advance!
